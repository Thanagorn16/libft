Libft Project
Overview
Libft is a custom implementation of essential C standard library functions, developed as part of the 42 school curriculum. This project aims to deepen understanding of C programming by recreating commonly used functions, which can be utilized in future projects.

Repository Structure and Purpose of Each File

ft_lstiter.c: Implements the ft_lstiter function, which applies a function to each element of a linked list.

ft_lstlast.c: Implements the ft_lstlast function, which returns the last element of a linked list.

ft_lstmap.c: Implements the ft_lstmap function, which creates a new linked list by applying a function to each element of an existing list.

ft_lstnew.c: Implements the ft_lstnew function, which creates a new linked list element.

ft_lstsize.c: Implements the ft_lstsize function, which counts the number of elements in a linked list.

ft_memchr.c: Implements the ft_memchr function, which locates a byte in a block of memory.

ft_memcmp.c: Implements the ft_memcmp function, which compares two blocks of memory.

ft_memcpy.c: Implements the ft_memcpy function, which copies memory from one location to another.

ft_memmove.c: Implements the ft_memmove function, which copies memory areas that may overlap.

ft_memset.c: Implements the ft_memset function, which fills a block of memory with a specific value.

ft_putchar_fd.c: Implements the ft_putchar_fd function, which writes a character to a file descriptor.

ft_putendl_fd.c: Implements the ft_putendl_fd function, which writes a string followed by a newline to a file descriptor.

ft_putnbr_fd.c: Implements the ft_putnbr_fd function, which writes an integer to a file descriptor.

ft_putstr_fd.c: Implements the ft_putstr_fd function, which writes a string to a file descriptor.

ft_split.c: Implements the ft_split function, which splits a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter.

ft_strchr.c: Implements the ft_strchr function, which locates the first occurrence of a character in a string.

ft_strdup.c: Implements the ft_strdup function, which duplicates a string.

ft_striteri.c: Implements the ft_striteri function, which applies a function to each character of a string, passing the index as the first argument.

ft_strjoin.c: Implements the ft_strjoin function, which concatenates two strings into a new string.

ft_strlcat.c: Implements the ft_strlcat function, which concatenates strings with size checking.

ft_strlcpy.c: Implements the ft_strlcpy function, which copies strings with size checking.

ft_strlen.c: Implements the ft_strlen function, which calculates the length of a string.

ft_strmapi.c: Implements the ft_strmapi function, which applies a function to each character of a string to create a new string.

ft_strncmp.c: Implements the ft_strncmp function, which compares two strings up to a specified number of characters.

ft_strnstr.c: Implements the ft_strnstr function, which locates a substring in a string, searching up to a specified length.

ft_strrchr.c: Implements the ft_strrchr function, which locates the last occurrence of a character in a string.

ft_strtrim.c: Implements the ft_strtrim function, which removes specified characters from the beginning and end of a string.

ft_substr.c: Implements the ft_substr function, which extracts a substring from a string.

ft_tolower.c: Implements the ft_tolower function, which converts an uppercase character to lowercase.

ft_toupper.c: Implements the ft_toupper function, which converts a lowercase character to uppercase.

This library serves as a foundational toolset for future C projects, providing custom implementations of standard functions to enhance understanding and control over fundamental operations.
