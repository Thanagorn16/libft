# Libft

A foundational C library that reimplements essential standard library functions and introduces custom utilities for handling memory, strings, and linked lists.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

Libft is a personal implementation of the core functions found in the C standard library, developed as part of the **42 School** curriculum. The goal of this project is to deepen understanding of low-level programming concepts, memory management, and to build a reusable set of utilities that can be used in future C projects.

This library includes:
- Common string, memory, and character manipulation functions
- Linked list handling tools
- A strong foundation for future C development

### âœ¨ Technologies Used

- **C language** â€“ Low-level system programming
- **Make** â€“ For build automation via a `Makefile`

### ðŸ’¡ Challenges Faced

- Managing memory safely and efficiently
- Understanding undefined behaviors in C standard functions
- Recreating complex functions like `ft_split`, `ft_lstmap`, and `ft_itoa` from scratch

### ðŸ”® Future Features

- Additional data structure implementations (e.g., stack, queue)
- Extended utility functions (e.g., custom printf)
- Performance benchmarking utilities
